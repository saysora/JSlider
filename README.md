# JSlider

I wanted to make a versatile and multiuse slider for my own scenarios. I especially didn't want the slider to be limited to just the kind that sits boringly at the top of websites, but a boilerplate for a customizable slider with features at your fingertips.

So, with some jQuery (which I will be happy to go more vague from there) I present JSlider.

The CSS is completely up to you to use.
